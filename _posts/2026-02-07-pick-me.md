## Pick Me: Responsibly adding books to my TBR

Every time I go to a bookstore, I pick up five different books. But which one will I like the most? This project will help me responsibly slow the growth of my TBR stack by estimating the rating I would give each book, using my own reading history as a data source.

## Learning Goals
- Create a new project from scratch, no templates
- Lean heavily on coding assistants
- Create a web-accessible site to solve a real problem I have!

## Stack/Tooling
- Claude Code VSCode plugin
- Postgres (hosted on Neon)
- Vercel for deploys and hosting
- Typescript 
- Next.js for routing (front and backend)

## Main Takeaways

Key insights from the project in 1-2 paragraphs.

## Reflections
