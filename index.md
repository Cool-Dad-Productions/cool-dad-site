# (Re-)Learning Modern Webdev in Public

I'm a big fan of silly, whimsical, or downright dumb projects as a way to stay engaged in learning. By stripping away the complexity of strict requirements and perfection, I can focus on the meta aspects of projects: tooling, processes, libraries, frameworks, platforms, and approaches.

Some of these projects will be half baked so expect some rough edges. I stay with a project long enough to help me meet my learning goals, not to produce the most polished version.

I'm not used to learning in public, so this is an uncomfortable experiment! With each project I'll try to capture what I set out to learn and some of my reflections on the process.

I also write about engineering management over at <a href="https://theeffortlessmanager.com/" target="_blank">The Effortless Manager</a> if you're into that sort of thing.
